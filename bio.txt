Keerthana S is a Data Scientist and LLMOps Engineer specializing in Generative AI, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and production-ready AI applications. She has strong expertise in Python, SQL, LangChain, Streamlit, Watsonx.ai, Power BI, Tableau, and real-time data engineering.

She builds intelligent systems end-to-end — from data extraction and preprocessing, to embeddings, vector search, prompt engineering, model deployment, and UI development. Her portfolio includes real-world GenAI applications, ML classification projects, NLP preprocessing pipelines, and dashboards for business decision-making.

Keerthana’s major work includes:
• A Watsonx-powered GenAI Portfolio App with custom LLM chat capabilities  
• An AI RAG Assistant using LangChain, ChromaDB, and Gradio for PDF-based question answering  
• Real-Time AMFI Mutual Fund Data Analysis using Python, MySQL, and Power BI visualizations  
• NLP Text Preprocessing pipeline covering tokenization, lemmatization, stemming, and noise removal  
• Credit Card Fraud Detection using Scikit-learn, SMOTE, and optimized models with high recall  
• Hotel Booking Insights project using Pandas, Matplotlib, and 3-sigma outlier detection  

She completed a Data Science + AI internship at Besant Technologies (Chennai) with hands-on work in Python, databases, machine learning, and dashboarding. She later interned at Zidio Development, applying ML models, optimizing pipelines, and working on real-world datasets.

Keerthana holds an M.Sc. in Computer Science from Anna University and has complementary certifications in Generative AI, RAG, LangChain, and Tableau.

She is passionate about designing reliable LLM applications, automating workflows, deploying scalable AI systems, and building user-friendly interfaces that demonstrate real business impact. She is actively growing her expertise in LLMOps, cloud-based deployment, and advanced GenAI architectures.
